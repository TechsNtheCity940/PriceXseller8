== Gathering Results

To evaluate whether the system successfully addresses the requirements and performs efficiently, we will focus on key performance indicators (KPIs) and conduct testing at various stages of development. The evaluation process will be split into two parts: core functionality validation and future feature readiness.

=== 1. Core Functionality Validation

The first set of performance evaluations will focus on the core functionality—document parsing, data extraction, and spreadsheet updates. The following criteria will be used:

==== Document Processing Accuracy
- **Goal**: Ensure that extracted data from invoices and documents is accurate, especially key fields like item names, quantities, prices, and dates.
- **KPIs**:
  - 95% accuracy in data extraction from structured documents (e.g., PDFs, Excel files).
  - 90% accuracy for data extracted via OCR from image-based files (e.g., JPEGs, scanned PDFs).
- **Testing Method**: Perform manual tests by comparing extracted data to the original documents across different formats and scenarios (e.g., low-quality scans, various invoice formats).

==== Spreadsheet Updates
- **Goal**: Ensure that the system properly updates the central spreadsheet with no data loss or duplication.
- **KPIs**:
  - 100% of data entries from each upload should be reflected in the correct tab or section of the spreadsheet (e.g., monthly costs, sales).
  - Spreadsheet structure should remain consistent, with correct formulas in place for calculations (e.g., total cost vs sales).
- **Testing Method**: Upload multiple documents and verify that the spreadsheet updates correctly after each upload, including batch processing scenarios.

==== Error Handling and Data Validation
- **Goal**: Ensure that the system properly detects and handles errors in extracted data (e.g., missing fields, incorrect formats) and allows for manual correction.
- **KPIs**:
  - 100% detection rate for invalid or incomplete data.
  - 95% of errors should be easily corrected by the user through the interface.
- **Testing Method**: Perform negative tests (e.g., upload incomplete or malformed documents) and verify that the system catches errors and provides helpful feedback.

=== 2. Future Feature Readiness

As the system grows to incorporate future features such as forecasting, analytics, and handling other document types, we will evaluate its scalability and flexibility:

==== Scalability for Future Features
- **Goal**: Ensure that the system can easily scale to handle new document types, increased data volumes, and additional features like forecasting and analytics.
- **KPIs**:
  - The system should be able to process batches of at least 100 documents in one upload without performance degradation.
  - Future extensions (e.g., new templates for document types, integration with databases) should require minimal changes to the existing architecture.
- **Testing Method**: Perform load tests with multiple file uploads and assess the system’s ability to scale. Prototype new document templates and verify that the system can process them with minimal changes.

==== Reporting and Analytics
- **Goal**: Ensure that basic reporting and analytics features (e.g., cost vs sales trends) are functional and extendable.
- **KPIs**:
  - Reports generated by the system should be accurate, reflecting the actual cost and sales data.
  - Analytics should be easily exportable to other formats (Excel, CSV, Google Sheets) or integrated with external systems in the future.
- **Testing Method**: Create test data for cost and sales over multiple months and verify that the system can generate accurate reports. Assess whether these reports can be exported or integrated with other systems efficiently.

=== 3. User Feedback and Iteration

- **Goal**: Ensure that the system is user-friendly and meets real-world requirements.
- **KPIs**:
  - User satisfaction rate of 90% or higher, based on feedback collected through surveys or interviews.
  - Minimal time required for users to correct parsing errors or make manual adjustments (less than 5 minutes per document).
- **Testing Method**: Conduct user testing sessions with potential users (e.g., those in the food and beverage industry) and gather feedback. Use this feedback to prioritize improvements in the system.

=== 4. Overall System Performance

- **Goal**: Ensure that the system runs efficiently, with minimal downtime or performance bottlenecks.
- **KPIs**:
  - Processing time for each document upload should be under 5 seconds for text-based files and under 10 seconds for image-based files using OCR.
  - Uptime of 99% or higher during active usage periods.
- **Testing Method**: Monitor system performance during test uploads, track processing times, and measure overall system stability over time. Use performance monitoring tools to identify and resolve any bottlenecks or issues.

=== 5. Post-Production Monitoring

After the system is deployed, ongoing monitoring will be needed to ensure it continues to meet performance expectations and handle real-world data effectively. Key areas to monitor:

- **System Logs**: Monitor logs for any recurring errors or warnings, especially related to document parsing or spreadsheet updates.
- **Performance Metrics**: Continuously track processing times, document parsing accuracy, and overall system uptime.
- **User Feedback**: Regularly collect user feedback on system performance, usability, and any challenges with document processing.
