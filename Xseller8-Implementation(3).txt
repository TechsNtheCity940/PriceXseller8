== Implementation

=== 1. Technology Stack

The following technologies will be used to build the system:

- **Backend**: Python is recommended for the backend due to its powerful libraries for parsing, OCR, and data handling. Flask or FastAPI can be used for creating the web API for file uploads and processing.
  
- **File Parsing & OCR**:
  - **PDF**: Use libraries such as `PyPDF2` or `pdfplumber` for parsing PDFs.
  - **Excel & CSV**: Use `pandas` and `openpyxl` to read and update Excel and CSV files.
  - **OCR**: For images, use the Tesseract OCR library (`pytesseract`) or a cloud-based solution like Google Vision or AWS Textract for more accurate recognition.
  
- **Spreadsheet Management**: 
  - Start with direct Excel updates using `openpyxl` or `pandas`.
  - Future integration with Google Sheets via their API or even a database for more complex handling.
  
- **Frontend (optional)**: A simple web interface can be built using React or Vue.js to allow users to upload documents and see processing results.

- **Database (future phase)**: PostgreSQL or MySQL can be used for storing invoice data and tracking item costs and sales across time for analytics and forecasting.

=== 2. Implementation Steps

The development will be broken down into the following steps:

==== Phase 1: Core Functionality (Invoicing & Spreadsheet Updates)

1. **Set up File Upload Module**:
   - Build the web API using Flask or FastAPI to accept file uploads.
   - Implement file type detection (based on extensions or file headers).

2. **Implement Data Extraction for PDFs, Excel, and CSVs**:
   - For PDFs, use `pdfplumber` or `PyPDF2` to extract text and relevant data fields (e.g., item name, quantity, price).
   - For Excel and CSV files, use `pandas` to extract similar information.

3. **Implement Basic OCR** (for image-based files like JPEGs or PNGs):
   - Integrate Tesseract or Google Vision for OCR to convert image content into text.
   - Extract key fields from the converted text.

4. **Data Validation**:
   - Add validation logic to ensure that extracted data is complete (e.g., no missing prices or quantities) before updating the spreadsheet.
   - Allow manual corrections if the system detects any errors.

5. **Spreadsheet Update**:
   - Use `openpyxl` to update the Excel spreadsheet with the extracted and validated data.
   - Organize the spreadsheet into tabs or sections for:
     - Total monthly costs by category (food, beverage, chemicals).
     - Sales data.
     - Item pricing updates.

==== Phase 2: Basic Analytics and Reporting

1. **Implement Basic Reporting Features**:
   - Add functionality for calculating cost vs sales trends.
   - Create summary views within the spreadsheet showing key performance indicators (KPIs) for each category (e.g., total spend, sales, and margins).

2. **Batch Processing of Multiple Files**:
   - Allow users to upload multiple documents at once and process them in batches.

==== Phase 3: OCR and Template Configurator

1. **Improve OCR Capabilities**:
   - Optimize the OCR module by adding support for more advanced OCR features, such as field-by-field recognition and correcting misread characters.
   - Integrate with cloud-based OCR solutions (Google Vision, AWS Textract) for improved accuracy.

2. **Template Configurator**:
   - Build an interface allowing users to define extraction rules for new document types, so the system can be extended to handle various kinds of invoices or receipts.

==== Phase 4: Future Enhancements (Forecasting, Advanced Analytics)

1. **Sales & Cost Forecasting**:
   - Build a module for predicting future costs and sales based on historical data.
   - Use simple statistical methods (e.g., moving averages) to forecast trends initially, with the option to expand to machine learning later.

2. **Integration with Databases**:
   - Migrate data storage from Excel to a relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
   - Use the database to store all invoice, sales, and cost data, which allows for more complex queries and analytics.

3. **Advanced Reporting & Analytics**:
   - Add dashboards for visualizing monthly performance, cost projections, and category-based expenses.

=== 3. Milestones

To track the progress of the implementation, the following milestones will be set:

- **Milestone 1**: Complete the file upload and basic data extraction for PDFs, Excel, and CSVs.
- **Milestone 2**: Implement basic OCR and spreadsheet updating capabilities.
- **Milestone 3**: Add basic error handling, data validation, and manual correction features.
- **Milestone 4**: Introduce batch processing and basic cost/sales analytics.
- **Milestone 5**: Enhance OCR accuracy and implement the template configurator.
- **Milestone 6**: Expand to sales forecasting and integrate with a relational database for more complex analytics.
